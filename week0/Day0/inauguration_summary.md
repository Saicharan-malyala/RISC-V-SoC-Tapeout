The session introduced the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program, a national initiative led by IIT Gandhinagar and VLSI System Design (VSD). It highlighted the program’s goal of empowering students and professionals with hands-on chip design skills, taking participants from RTL design to real silicon tapeout in 20 weeks. The organizers emphasized bridging the gap between academia and industry by adopting practical, fabrication-focused training. This initiative aligns with India’s semiconductor self-reliance mission, offering free access to premium physical design workshops for committed learners.
