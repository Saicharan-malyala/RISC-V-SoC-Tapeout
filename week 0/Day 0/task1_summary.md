Session Summary

This session introduced the basics of digital VLSI System-on-Chip (SoC) design and planning. The workflow starts with chip modeling, where specifications are defined using a C model and tested with a C language testbench. Next, the RTL architect step involves creating a soft copy of the hardware using RTL (Verilog), breaking the design into core blocks like processors and peripherals. After this, the design moves into synthesis, producing gate-level netlists, synthesizing macros, and handling analog IPs. Finally, everything comes together during SoC integration, which connects different components (like GPIOs) and gets the whole chip ready for fabrication, following the flow from RTL to GDS.

Microcontroller vs Microprocessor

In the session, the difference between microcontrollers and microprocessors was discussed:

A microcontroller combines processor, memory, and peripherals within a single chip, making it ideal for embedded and control-oriented tasks.

A microprocessor, in contrast, focuses mainly on executing tasks and relies on external modules for memory and peripherals, generally used in computers needing higher processing capabilities.
